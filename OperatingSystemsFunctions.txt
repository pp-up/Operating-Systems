Another function of an operating system is memory management.
The operating system's function is to also store and allocate memory.
This happens when someone accesses a file which then goes from the storage to the RAM.
A third function of an OS would also be multitasking.
The OS can run a certain application or task very quickly and switch to the next task.
It runs each task one at a time but runs the program very fast, taking little time which is processed by the CPU.
